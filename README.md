Classification and clustering of the text dataset

In this project, I compaired the accuracy of different classification algorithm and also apply clustering method.

I started with supervised learning, in which I used different quantitative methods such as TfidfVectorizer,
Count vectorizor,etc to turn document into computer readable format and on this appy different supervised
methods and analyze it. Also I tried clustering algorithm on same dataset to see how clustering algorithm
work on it.

I used Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries to complete the project.
